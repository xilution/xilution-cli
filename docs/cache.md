# Cache

The Xilution CLI caches authentication data in `~/.xilution/cache.json`.
This includes OAuth tokens and other information available when authenticating to the Xilution platform.
Like `config.json` (see [Config](./config.md) for details), `cache.json` is organized by context profile.
You can delete `cache.json` anytime you want.
Xilution CLI will automatically recreate it when necessary.
